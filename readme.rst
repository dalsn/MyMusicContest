This project was built using the PHP web framework, CodeIgniter.

My Files (files I coded):

mymusic.sql,
application/controller/home.php,
application/views/homepage.php,
application/views/report.php,
application/models/user_dl.php

To run, copy the entire repository to a folder (MyMusicContest) in the root directory of a PHP server.

To configure database connection, go into application/config/database.php. Then set hostname, username, password and database accordingly.

###################
What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
